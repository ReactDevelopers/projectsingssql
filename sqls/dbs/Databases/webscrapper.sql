When I say direct waterfront ,I mean catch fish on your first cast of the year from the shower, waterfront. Not some weedchoked gut at high tide or dead water uptown canal, where the only smell is diesel fuel in the morning. Dolphins ride the incoming tide because it is easy and exhale in night when I try to sleep. I sit in bed in the winter morning, drinking coffee , reading and watch the seals sun on the marsh,(think labrador retriever with no legs nor ears.I\'ve seen lost whales come by and even whitetail deer swim downtide. Birding is spectacular . The haunting call of the loon last through the winter and into spring. This is a lifestyle home. We swim,fish, kayak, dive and study the bay,do yoga and tai chi on the dock. We participate with the bay, we don\'t just watch it and this is a wonderful place for kids. Imagine a marine labratory in your front yard. well that is what we do here.

Hyde Park\'s also home to Frank Lloyd Wright\'s iconic Robie House, probably the finest example of Prairie School architecture in existence.
